# **App Name**: Cryptic Comm

## Core Features:

- Themed UI: Sleek and intuitive interface mimicking spy gadgets.
- Text-to-Morse: Convert text into Morse code using a mapping dictionary.
- Morse-to-Text: Convert Morse code (text) into readable text.
- Audio-to-Morse AI: Analyze audio input to detect Morse code beeps using a trained AI model; the AI model will be used as a tool to filter noise and detect beeps.
- Real-Time Display: Display the converted text or Morse code in real-time.

## Style Guidelines:

- Dark, muted backgrounds like charcoal gray (#333333) to enhance the spy theme.
- Use of neon green (#39FF14) as an accent color to mimic classic spy tech.
- Subtle use of a dark blue (#003366) to provide depth and sophistication.
- Clear, monospace font for displaying Morse code.
- Simple, outline-style icons for navigation.
- Clean and organized layout, prioritizing functionality.
- Subtle transitions and animations for user feedback.

## Original User Request:
I want to create an application with beautiful ui , the theme should be spy related , it should have features to convert morse code into text and vica versa and also from morse audio into text , something more for details you can make it by yourself also 1. Textual Morse Code (e.g., ... --- ...) You don’t need an AI model—a simple mapping/dictionary-based approach is more efficient.

Tools:

Python or JavaScript

Use a dictionary to map Morse to letters

No AI needed here.

Audio Morse Code (beeps) Now you can bring in AI to detect patterns.
Workflow:

Convert audio to spectrogram or MFCC features

Train a model to detect dots, dashes, and pauses

Decode the sequence using rules

AI Tools:

Librosa or pydub (for audio processing)

TensorFlow or PyTorch (for ML model)

CNN or LSTM model to detect patterns from audio features

Visual Morse Code (e.g., blinking lights or flashing patterns) Here, computer vision can help recognize dot-dash patterns.
AI Tools:

OpenCV for image/video processing

YOLOv5 or custom CNN for identifying light states (on = signal, off = pause)

RNN or LSTM to sequence the flashes into Morse symbols
